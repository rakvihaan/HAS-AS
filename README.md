## Working
---
- Let's start with the working of the **Laser Tripwire Alarm System**
  - The Alarm system uses a traditional laser module, an LDR, a buzzer, an LED and to carry out the function an Arduino (Any Arduino will work fine).
    - An LDR or Light Dependent Resistor changes it's resistance value depending on the level of light, which can be used as an input device to the arduino to read, and detect the light levels. In simple words it is used to detect light levels.
